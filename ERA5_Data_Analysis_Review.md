# ERA5 Weather Data Analysis Review

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive review of the data preprocessing and feature engineering approaches used in the ERA5 weather data analysis project. Several key issues have been identified in the current methodology that could impact model performance and validity. For each issue, detailed explanations and concrete code improvements are provided.

## 1. Data Splitting Methodology Issues

### Problem Identified

The report describes feature engineering performed before proper train-test split, which risks data leakage:

> "We verified that no covariates were disproportionately distributed between the two splits (i.e., the data split is balanced, making our analysis unbiased)."

While the code appears to split data first:

```python
train_test_data = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=0.2, random_state=5059)
temp_full_cleaned = temp_full.dropna(subset=['ptype'])
[(temp_total_index, temp_test_index)] = train_test_data.split(
    temp_full_cleaned, temp_full_cleaned['ptype']
)
```

But the statement about feature engineering before splitting and the data processing flow raises concerns about potential data leakage.

### Why This Is Problematic

When feature engineering occurs before splitting data, information from the test set can "leak" into the training process, resulting in artificially inflated performance metrics that won't generalize to new data.

### Suggested Improvement

Ensure strict separation of data before any feature engineering:

```python
# Step 1: Split data first
X_full = temp_full.drop('t2m', axis=1)
y_full = temp_full['t2m']

# Use TimeSeriesSplit for time series data
tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(X_full):
    X_train, X_test = X_full.iloc[train_index], X_full.iloc[test_index]
    y_train, y_test = y_full.iloc[train_index], y_full.iloc[test_index]
    
    # Step 2: Apply feature engineering only to training data
    feature_engineering = ColumnTransformer([...])
    feature_engineering.fit(X_train)  # Fit only on training data
    
    # Step 3: Transform both sets using parameters learned from training
    X_train_transformed = feature_engineering.transform(X_train)
    X_test_transformed = feature_engineering.transform(X_test)
```

### Explanation in Simple Terms

Think of this like preparing for an exam. If you look at the test questions before studying, you'll focus only on those specific questions and get a high score - but you haven't truly learned the material. Similarly, if your model "sees" test data during preparation, it will appear to perform well on that specific data but fail on truly new information.

## 2. Feature Selection Justification

### Problem Identified

In the report, variable selection is primarily based on correlation:

> "Looking at the correlation matrix for the training set, we saw that u10 and u100 were strongly correlated (0.98), and so were v10 and v100. Since we are more interested in the temperature at 2m, we drop the u100 and v100, since we gain no further information by keeping it."

The corresponding code simply omits these features:

```python
numerical_features = ['latitude','longitude','u10','v10','sp','tcc']
# Note: u100 and v100 are missing from this list
```

### Why This Is Problematic

High correlation doesn't necessarily mean redundancy in predictive modeling. Different but correlated variables can capture unique aspects of the phenomenon, especially in edge cases or special conditions. Wind measurements at different heights can provide complementary information about atmospheric conditions.

### Suggested Improvement

Use feature importance methods to empirically test the value of these features:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModel

# Train a model to evaluate feature importance
rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=5059)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Visualize feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': X_train.columns,
    'importance': rf.feature_importances_
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

plt.barh(feature_importance['feature'], feature_importance['importance'])
plt.title("Feature Importance Analysis")
plt.xlabel("Importance")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Use a threshold-based feature selector
selector = SelectFromModel(rf, threshold='median')
X_train_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
X_test_selected = selector.transform(X_test)

# Get selected feature names
selected_features = X_train.columns[selector.get_support()]
print(f"Selected features: {selected_features}")
```

### Explanation in Simple Terms

Imagine two witnesses to an event who usually tell similar stories (correlated variables). However, in certain situations, one witness notices details the other misses. Just because they generally agree doesn't mean you should ignore one completely. Similarly, even highly correlated weather variables might each contribute unique information in specific conditions that improve overall prediction accuracy.

## 3. Temporal Feature Handling

### Problem Identified

The current approach simplifies time features by binning:

> "Time: Given in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format (with minutes and seconds always set to 00 and year being 2018). Since temperature trends heavily fluctuate over the year (Fig. ), we grouped MM-DD into months (Jan-Dec)... Also, we expect temperature to rise over Night → Morning → Afternoon and decrease in the Evening. So, we split HH into these 4 categories"

The code implementation:

```python
if self.add_time_month:
     X['month'] = X[valid_t].dt.month
     
     X['time_of_day'] = pd.cut(
        X[valid_t].dt.hour,
        bins=[0, 6, 12, 18, 24],
        labels=['Night', 'Morning', 'Afternoon', 'Evening'],
        right=False
    )
```

### Why This Is Problematic

This approach breaks the continuous and cyclical nature of time. In simple categorization, December (12) and January (1) appear very different numerically, but they're adjacent months with similar conditions. Similarly, 11PM and 12AM are treated as completely different categories despite being just an hour apart.

### Suggested Improvement

Use cyclical encoding to preserve the continuity of time features:

```python
# Add cyclical encoding for month and hour
def add_cyclical_features(df, col_name, period):
    """
    Create cyclical features for temporal data
    
    Args:
        df: DataFrame containing the data
        col_name: Column name to encode
        period: Cycle period (e.g., 12 for months, 24 for hours)
    """
    df[f'{col_name}_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df[col_name]/period)
    df[f'{col_name}_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df[col_name]/period)
    return df

# In the feature engineering pipeline:
X['month'] = X[valid_t].dt.month
X['hour'] = X[valid_t].dt.hour

# Add cyclical encoding
X = add_cyclical_features(X, 'month', 12)  # 12 months in a year
X = add_cyclical_features(X, 'hour', 24)   # 24 hours in a day
```

### Explanation in Simple Terms

Think of time as a circle rather than a straight line. On a clock, 11:59 PM and 12:01 AM are just 2 minutes apart, not nearly a day apart. The same applies to December 31st and January 1st. By representing time in a way that preserves this "circular" nature, we help the model understand that these times are closely related, rather than appearing at opposite ends of a scale.

## 4. Neighbor Feature Implementation

### Problem Identified

The current approach for handling neighboring data points has issues with edge cases:

> "In a few cases (e.g., Northern Ireland), the 3x3 neighborhood was incomplete due to the train-test split. We encountered only 6 such instances and omitted those points, considering the impact negligible."

The code implementation shows problematic edge handling:

```python
def find_neighbors_fast(x, y, k, left_border, right_border, lower_border, upper_border):
    # deal with the borders
    if x == left_border:
        x += k
    elif x == right_border:
        x -= k
    if y == lower_border:
        y += k
    elif y == upper_border:
        y -= k

    offset_grid = np.array(np.meshgrid(dx, dy)).T.reshape(-1, 2)
    neighbors = [(x + dx_i, y + dy_i) for dx_i, dy_i in offset_grid]
    return neighbors
```

The neighbor feature calculation further shows issues:

```python
for row in tqdm(X.itertuples(index=False), total=len(X), desc="Processing rows"):
    key = (row.longitude, row.latitude, row.valid_hour)
    neighbors = find_neighbors_fast(row.longitude, row.latitude, k, left_border, right_border, lower_border, upper_border)
    neighbors = [(lon, lat, row.valid_hour) for lon, lat in neighbors]

    # Get available neighbors
    available_neighbors = [data_dict[n] for n in neighbors if n in data_dict]

    u_vals, v_vals, p_vals = zip(*available_neighbors)
    u_mean = np.mean(u_vals)
    v_mean = np.mean(v_vals)
    p_mean = np.mean(p_vals)
```

### Why This Is Problematic

1. Moving border points instead of adapting calculations introduces artificial data points
2. Omitting points at borders wastes data that could be valuable
3. Edge locations often have unique climate characteristics (e.g., coastal areas)
4. The "6 instances" mentioned may be an underestimate of affected points
5. The approach assumes a regular grid and doesn't account for geographic reality
6. No time-based neighboring is implemented, only spatial

### Suggested Improvement

Implement a more robust neighbor-finding function that handles edge cases gracefully and includes temporal neighbors:

```python
def safe_get_neighbors(df, lat, lon, time, spatial_k=0.25, temporal_hours=1):
    """
    Get neighbors safely by finding all available points within range
    without artificial adjustments. Includes both spatial and temporal neighbors.
    
    Args:
        df: DataFrame containing all data points
        lat, lon: Coordinates of the target point
        time: Timestamp of the target point
        spatial_k: Distance range to consider neighbors
        temporal_hours: Hours before/after to consider as temporal neighbors
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with spatial and temporal neighbor information
    """
    # Convert time to datetime if it's not already
    if not isinstance(time, pd.Timestamp):
        time = pd.to_datetime(time)
    
    # Find spatial neighbors at the same time
    spatial_neighbors = df[
        (df['latitude'].between(lat-spatial_k, lat+spatial_k)) &
        (df['longitude'].between(lon-spatial_k, lon+spatial_k)) &
        (df['valid_time'] == time) &
        # Exclude the point itself
        ~((df['latitude'] == lat) & (df['longitude'] == lon))
    ]
    
    # Find temporal neighbors at the same location
    temporal_neighbors = df[
        (df['latitude'] == lat) &
        (df['longitude'] == lon) &
        (df['valid_time'] != time) &  # Different time
        (df['valid_time'].between(
            time - pd.Timedelta(hours=temporal_hours),
            time + pd.Timedelta(hours=temporal_hours)
        ))

    return df
```

### Explanation in Simple Terms

Imagine analyzing temperature on a map. Points at the edges of the map (like coastlines) are just as important as central points, and might even show interesting patterns where land meets water. The current approach either artificially moves these edge points or ignores them completely. 

Our improved approach is like having a flexible camera lens - when looking at edge points, we simply work with whatever neighboring points are available, adapting to each situation. We also look at how conditions change over time at the same location (temporal neighbors), giving a more complete picture of weather patterns. This preserves real geographic relationships and doesn't waste valuable data, especially at interesting boundary locations where weather patterns often change most dramatically.

## 5. Precipitation Type Handling

### Problem Identified

The report mentions:

> "Finally, we merged the precipitation type into 4 categories, as mentioned above."

The code implements this as:

```python
if self.change_ptype:
    X['ptype'] = X['ptype'].map({0:'No Precipitation',1:'Rain',
    3:'Solid Precipitation',5:'Solid Precipitation',8:'Solid Precipitation',
    6:'Semi-Solid Precipitation',7:'Semi-Solid Precipitation'})
```

### Why This Is Problematic

The merging of categories is done without validating whether the merged categories actually have similar relationships with temperature. Different precipitation types may have distinct temperature profiles even if they seem conceptually similar.

### Suggested Improvement

Verify that the merged categories are actually similar in terms of their relationship with temperature:

```python
import seaborn as sns

# Analyze relationship between original categories and temperature
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='ptype', y='t2m', data=temp_train)
plt.title("Temperature Distribution by Original Precipitation Types")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Calculate mean temperature for each precipitation type
ptype_temp = temp_train.groupby('ptype')['t2m'].agg(['mean', 'count', 'std'])
print("Temperature statistics by precipitation type:")
print(ptype_temp)

# Test statistical significance of differences
from scipy.stats import f_oneway

# Group the data by proposed merged categories
no_precip = temp_train[temp_train['ptype'] == 0]['t2m']
rain = temp_train[temp_train['ptype'] == 1]['t2m']
solid = temp_train[temp_train['ptype'].isin([3, 5, 8])]['t2m']
semi_solid = temp_train[temp_train['ptype'].isin([6, 7])]['t2m']

# Perform ANOVA to check if groups are significantly different
f_stat, p_val = f_oneway(no_precip, rain, solid, semi_solid)
print(f"ANOVA test: F={f_stat:.2f}, p={p_val:.6f}")

# Only merge if justified by data
if p_val < 0.05:  # Categories are significantly different
    X['ptype_merged'] = X['ptype'].map({
        0: 'No Precipitation', 
        1: 'Rain',
        3: 'Solid', 5: 'Solid', 8: 'Solid',
        6: 'Semi-Solid', 7: 'Semi-Solid'
    })
else:
    print("Warning: Categories not significantly different, reconsider merging")
```

### Explanation in Simple Terms

When grouping different types of precipitation together, we need to make sure they actually have similar effects on temperature. It's like grouping foods - you wouldn't put spicy peppers and sweet apples in the same category just because they're both plants. We should analyze the data to see if different precipitation types actually relate to temperature in similar ways before combining them. This statistical validation ensures our grouping is based on actual patterns in the data, not just conceptual similarity.

## 6. Inappropriate Evaluation Metrics

### Problem Identified

The report mentions:

> "Looking at other models that perform similar predictions for temperature, it is seen to be better to prioritise accuracy and attempting to maximise that. We aim for an accuracy of above 80%, so 8 out of 10 times, we will successfully predict the temperature."

And within the code, the evaluation metrics have issues:

```python
def evaluate_model(model, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, model_name):
    # ...
    train_rmse = math.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_train, y_train_pred))
    train_r2 = r2_score(y_train, y_train_pred)
    train_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_train, y_train_pred)
    # ...
    val_rmse = math.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_val, y_val_pred))
    val_r2 = r2_score(y_val, y_val_pred)
    val_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_val, y_val_pred)
```

### Why This Is Problematic

1. "Accuracy" is a classification metric, not appropriate for regression problems like temperature prediction
2. The code correctly uses RMSE, R², and MAE, but the report's language is inconsistent with these metrics
3. Talking about "8 out of 10 times" implies a binary success/failure outcome, which doesn't apply to continuous regression predictions
4. No thresholds are defined for what constitutes a "successful" temperature prediction

### Suggested Improvement

Clarify the evaluation approach and define appropriate metrics and thresholds:

```python
def evaluate_regression_model(model, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, model_name, 
                             acceptable_error=1.0):  # 1 degree Kelvin tolerance
    """

        acceptable_error: Threshold for counting a prediction as "acceptable"
    """
    # Make predictions
    y_train_pred = model.predict(X_train)
    y_val_pred = model.predict(X_val)
    
    # Standard regression metrics
    metrics = {}
    
    # Training metrics
    metrics['train_rmse'] = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_train, y_train_pred))

    metrics['train_success_rate'] = 100 * np.mean(train_errors <= acceptable_error)
    metrics['val_success_rate'] = 100 * np.mean(val_errors <= acceptable_error)
    
    # Report results
    print(f"\n{model_name} Evaluation:")
    print(f"Training - RMSE: {metrics['train_rmse']:.4f}, MAE: {metrics['train_mae']:.4f}, R²: {metrics['train_r2']:.4f}")
    print(f"Training - Success rate: {metrics['train_success_rate']:.2f}% within {acceptable_error}K")
    print(f"Validation - RMSE: {metrics['val_rmse']:.4f}, MAE: {metrics['val_mae']:.4f}, R²: {metrics['val_r2']:.4f}")
    print(f"Validation - Success rate: {metrics['val_success_rate']:.2f}% within {acceptable_error}K")
    
    # Check for overfitting
    if metrics['train_rmse'] < 0.8 * metrics['val_rmse']:
        print("Warning: Model may be overfitting (training RMSE much lower than validation RMSE)")
    
    # Create error distribution plot
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
    
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    plt.hist(train_errors, bins=50, alpha=0.7)

### Explanation in Simple Terms

When predicting a continuous value like temperature, we need to use the right tools to measure success. It's like measuring distance – you'd use meters or feet, not a simple "close/far" judgment. The report incorrectly talks about "accuracy" (which is like saying "I got 8 out of 10 questions right"), but temperature prediction needs metrics like "average error in degrees" (RMSE/MAE) or "percentage of explained variance" (R²).

Our improved approach properly measures how close predictions are to actual temperatures using appropriate regression metrics. We also add a clear definition of what constitutes a "successful" prediction (within 1 degree Kelvin) to translate these statistical measures into a more intuitive "success rate" that matches the original goal but is mathematically sound.

## 7. Data Leakage Risk in Time Series Analysis

### Problem Identified

The report doesn't explicitly mention time-aware validation, and the code uses standard random splitting:

```python
train_test_data = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=0.2, random_state=5059)
```

### Why This Is Problematic

Weather data is inherently time-dependent. Using random splits can create a situation where the model is trained on future data and asked to predict past data, which is impossible in real-world applications and leads to overestimated performance.

### Suggested Improvement

Implement time-series aware cross-validation:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

# Convert to datetime if not already
temp_full['valid_time'] = pd.to_datetime(temp_full['valid_time'])

# Sort by time
temp_full = temp_full.sort_values('valid_time')

# Use time series split instead of random split
tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)

# Track performance across time splits
cv_scores = []

for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(temp_full):
    X_train, X_test = temp_full.iloc[train_index], temp_full.iloc[test_index]
    y_train, y_test = X_train['t2m'], X_test['t2m']
    
    # Remove target from features
    X_train = X_train.drop('t2m', axis=1)
    X_test = X_test.drop('t2m', axis=1)
    
    # Process data and train model
    # ...
    
    # Evaluate and store results
    cv_scores.append(model_score)

print(f"Time-series CV scores: {cv_scores}")
print(f"Mean CV score: {np.mean(cv_scores):.4f} ± {np.std(cv_scores):.4f}")

# Visualize time-split performance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(cv_scores, marker='o')
plt.xlabel("Time Period")
plt.ylabel("Model Performance (RMSE)")
plt.title("Model Performance Across Time")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Explanation in Simple Terms

Weather prediction is like forecasting the future based on past observations. In real life, we can only use historical data to predict what happens next - we can't use tomorrow's weather to predict yesterday's. By randomly shuffling data for training and testing, we're creating an unrealistic scenario that makes our models seem better than they actually are. Using time-aware validation ensures our evaluation honestly represents how the model will perform in real-world conditions where it must always predict forward in time, never backward.

## Summary of Key Recommendations

1. **Data Split Methodology**: Always split data before feature engineering and use time-aware splits for time series data
2. **Feature Selection**: Use empirical feature importance rather than correlation alone to determine which features to keep
3. **Temporal Features**: Implement cyclical encoding for time features to preserve their continuous nature
4. **Neighboring Features**: Use robust methods that handle edge cases without artificial data manipulation
5. **Category Merging**: Validate category merging statistically before implementing
6. **Evaluation Metrics**: Use appropriate regression metrics and clearly define what constitutes a "successful" prediction
7. **Time Series Validation**: Implement proper time series cross-validation to prevent data leakage

By addressing these issues, the project will produce more robust, reliable, and accurate temperature predictions that will generalize better to new data.
