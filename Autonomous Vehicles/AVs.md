**Driving Style Characterization**: the process of quantitatively analyzing and classifying a driver's unique behavioral patterns behind the wheel using **measurable parameters**
- involves extracting key features from driving data to model how a driver typically accelerates, brakes, steers, and reacts to traffic conditions
- Why "Characterization" (Not Just "Description")?
    - Description = Subjective labels (e.g., "This driver is reckless").
    - Characterization = Objective, data-driven modeling (e.g., "Jerk > 0.5 m/s³ → high aggression likelihood").
