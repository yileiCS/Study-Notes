# [Knowledge Graph (KG)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/knowledge-graph)

## What is knowledge graph?
- Known as a **Semantic Network**
- A structured representation of knowledge using nodes (entities) and edges (relationships)
- represents a network of real-world entities
  - such as: objects, events, situations or concepts
  - illustrates the relationship between them
- This information is usually stored in a graph database and visualized as **graph structure**
- consists of: 
  - a set of **nodes**
  - a set of **edges** connecting the nodes 
  - a set of **labels/labels**  
  - an assignment function which associates an edge with a label
- Any object, place, or person can be a node. An edge defines the relationship between the nodes

## Ontology
- A formal and structured representation of knowledge, including concepts, relationships, and properties within a specific domain 
- defines the structure and relationships of concepts within a specific domain
- serve to create a formal representation of the entities in the KG
- purpose: provides a consistent and well-defined structure for organizing and representing data 
- usually based on a **taxanomy**
  - can contain multiple taxonomies, it maintains its own separate definition
- has similar manner with KGs: i.e. nodes and edges, and are based on the **Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples**

## How a knowledge graph works?
- KGs are typically made up of datasets from various sources, which frequently differ in structure.
- **Schemas**, **identities** and **context** work together to provide structure to diverse data.

### Fueled by machine learning
KGs, that are fueled by machine learning, utilize **natural language processing (NLP)** to construct a comprehensive view of nodes, edges, and labels through a process called **semantic enrichment**. 
- When data is ingested, this process allows KGs to:
  - identify individual objects
  - understand the relationships between different objects
- Once a KG is complete, it allows question answering and search systems to retrieve and reuse comprehensive answers to given queries
